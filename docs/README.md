# Documentation

Mock Data Engine API is a FastAPI service for generating realistic synthetic data from YAML schemas. You define the shape and constraints of your data, hit an endpoint, get records back. It also does real-time WebSocket streaming, dual-layer persistence, and has a built-in chaos injection system for testing how well your consumers handle bad data.
